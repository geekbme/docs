### Responsive Layout

![][responsive]

Graffito's responsive grid system is designed for desktop, tablet and smartphone systems, each with minor modifications to ensure compatibility in each mode.

We use the responsive layout based on Twitter's Bootstrap Framework, with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.

### Powered by Gantry 4 Framework

Graffito is the first RocketTheme theme built on the Gantry4 Framework with a new, faster administration UI. One of the other exciting new features is the ability to use LESS CSS to make developing themes easier, more flexible, and overall, more enjoyable.
