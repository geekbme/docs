There are two menu options, SplitMenu and Fusion Menu. The Splitmenu is a static menu system that displays select menu items in a main horizontal menu. The Fusion Menu is an advanced, CSS based menu system, which offers a wide range of per menu options.

### RTL Support

Theme side RTL support from the Fusion menu to the Typography. This is in conjunction with Gantry's RTL support for the automatic flipping of the grid system. If an RTL language is enabled in WordPress, the theme will automatically adjust to the RTL layout.
