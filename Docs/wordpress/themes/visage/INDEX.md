![][splitmenu]

There are two menu options, SplitMenu and Fusion Menu. The Splitmenu is a static menu system that displays select menu items in a main horizontal menu. The Fusion Menu is an advanced, CSS based menu system, which offers a wide range of per menu options.

### Blog Layout

Visage has a custom blog layout (available on our frontpage demo) where it has a left aligned, and tab-styled date to provide distinct visuals as compared to the standard WordPress layout. The title also supports a custom, calligraphic-styled font.
