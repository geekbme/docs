Kirigami, the March 2013 theme release, is the first responsive RocketTheme theme built with the Gantry 4 Framework. A responsive design adapts itself to a particular viewing environment such as desktop or mobile, without the need for separate layouts for varying platforms.

### Responsive Layout

![][responsive]

Kirigami's **responsive** grid system is designed for **desktop**, **tablet** and **smartphone** systems, each with minor modifications to ensure compatibility in each mode.

We use the responsive layout based on [Twitter's Bootstrap Framework][bootstrap], with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.

The table below shows the breakdown of screen resolutions and associated devices, and what layout characters are then applied to each.

| Label                  | Description                                | Layout Width     | Column Width |  
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------- |
