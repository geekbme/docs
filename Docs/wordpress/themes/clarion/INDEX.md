Introduction

Clarion is a subtle, conservatively styled design, that is primed for business use, whilst still providing a platform for flexibility, in terms of structure, layout and style possibilities. It is the perfect base for individualization, exemplified by its user friendly interface.

Custom styling is used for content images and RokGallery grid images to complement the conservative design. A bolded white border with a box shadow is added for a subtle effect. RokGallery also benefits from a cornered overlay on hover.

### Mobile Theme

Clarion is available in a fixed layout, with a separate mobile layout for iPhone and Android devices. These mobile layouts can be configured via our Gantry admin. We also include a set of position aliases that provide you additional control over your mobile content.
