* Apache 2.x or Microsoft IIS 7
* PHP 5.4+
* MySQL 5.0.4 or higher
* WordPress 5.x
* Gantry Framework

>> NOTE: An updated version of the Gantry 4 Framework is required for Entropy to work correctly. For more details on the Gantry Framework, please visit its [Dedicated Website][gantry].

Key Features
-----

* 960 Fixed Layout
* Preset Styles
* Widget Positions
* Widget Variations
* Fusion-Menu and Split-Menu
* Custom Typography
* iPhone/Android Theme
* iPhone Menu

### Custom Font

![][font]

The richness of the Entropy design is composited in part from its prolific use of custom fonts for varying title elements, ranging from content posts to widget titles and textual elements in the various extensions, such as the headers for each pane, providing uniqueness.

### Smooth Scroll

The theme is outfitted with Smooth Scroll, which adds a smooth animation effect to page anchors. The effect is triggered when the top button is clicked, smoothly scrolling to the top of the page. It also works for sectional scrolling, as demoed in the 1st level menu items.
