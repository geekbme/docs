## Is Zenith compatible for WordPress 1.5 or 2.5?

No, Zenith is only compatible with WordPress 3.4+.

## What is Gantry?

[Gantry][gantry] is, as a basic definition, a framework used for assembling, building and maintaining a RocketTheme theme. It is an advanced platform for dramatically extending the capabilities of the entire theming system of WordPress.

## Can I install RocketLauncher onto an existing WordPress! website?

No. RocketLauncher will install both WordPress and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh WordPress! installation.

## I installed Zenith RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.

To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.

## How to I Switch between Full Width and Standard Layout Styles?

Zenith is extremely versatile, and you can switch between the standard layout (featured in our demo and RocketLauncher by default) or a Full Width one that hugs the edges of your browser. To do so, simply do the following:

* Navigate to the Global Page Settings by going to **Administrator > Base Outline > Page Settings** or to the **Page Settings** tab in a single outline you'd like to apply full width styling to.
* Enter `fullwidth` in the Body Classes field within the **Body Attributes** area of the page.
* Select the **Save Page Settings** button.

This will apply full width styling either as a global default (Base Outline) or to pages assigned to a specific outline.
