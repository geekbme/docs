Here is the widget breakdown for the Feature section:

#### RokSprocket (Mosaic)

This area of the demo is a RokSprocket widget. You will need to do two things to prepare this widget so that it looks similar to the one in the demo.

First, you will need to create the RokSprocket Widget. You can do this by navigating to **Administration -> RokSprocket Admin** and creating a new **Mosaic** widget.

You can find out more about RokSprocket and how to set up and modify widgets by visiting our [RokSprocket documentation](../../plugins/roksprocket).

**Simple Content Provider**

We used the **Simple Provider** to enable us to create custom RokSprocket content without having to create separate posts or pages to do so. Here are the details of one of the **Simple Items** in the **Featured Article List**.
