Introduction
-----

![][fracture]

Fracture, the April 2013 theme release, is a RocketTheme theme built upon the Gantry4 Framework which features a responsive layout core, a rejuvenated administrative interface, and optimized coding. The theme focuses on a clean and minimal design with a unique overlay system for stunning results.

The theme also uses LESS, a dynamic stylesheet language, that extends CSS with dynamic behavior. RokSprocket further benefits from custom styling, adding rich focus to a conservative design backdrop.

### Responsive Layout

![][responsive]

Fracture's **responsive** grid system is designed for **desktop**, **tablet** and **smartphone** systems, each with minor modifications to ensure compatibility in each mode.

We use the responsive layout based on [Twitter's Bootstrap Framework][bootstrap], with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.

### Powered by Gantry 4 Framework

![][gantry4]

Fracture is the first RocketTheme theme built on the Gantry4 Framework with a new, faster administration UI. One of the other exciting new features is the ability to use LESS CSS to make developing themes easier, more flexible, and overall, more enjoyable.

### Responsive Layout for RokSprocket
