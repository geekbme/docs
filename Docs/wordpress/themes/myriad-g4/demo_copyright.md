#### Gantry Branding

The Gantry Branding widget does little more than display our logo at the bottom of the page. Simply click and drag the **Gantry Branding** widget into the widget section for this to appear.

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry Copyright

The Gantry Copyright widget places a tiny Copyright notification at the bottom of the page. The only thing you need to change in this widget to match the demo is the text field, which includes: `&copy; 2015 by RocketTheme`.

#### Gantry To Top

The Gantry To Top widget is a simple indicator which allows users to jump to the top of a page with a single click. Just click and drag this widget into the section to activate it.
