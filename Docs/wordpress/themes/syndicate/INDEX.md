Gantry offers a grid system, splitting widget position rows into blocks of up to 6 widgets, side by side. Their widths can be adjusted in the administrator. This is based off of a figure of 12, such as 4|4|4, but with Syndicate, this is 16, allowing for more precision such as 6|6|4.

### Split/Fusion Menu

Syndicate has two menu options, SplitMenu and Fusion Menu. The Splitmenu is a static menu system that displays select menu items in a main horizontal menu. The Fusion Menu is an advanced, CSS based menu system, which offers a wide range of per menu options.
