Cerulean, the July 2013 theme release, is a beautifully constructed theme with a three-dimensional style design to add depth to content. An array of widget variations add focal points for the mainbody area.

### Responsive Layout
![][responsive]
Cerulean's responsive grid system is designed for desktop, tablet and smartphone systems, each with minor modifications to ensure compatibility in each mode.

We use the responsive layout based on Twitter's Bootstrap Framework, with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.

### Advanced Dropdown Menu
![][dropdown]
For mobile devices, a basic version of the Dropdown Menu will be used. It is activated by a custom menu icon in the top left of the screen. It will either be a tree view or select box menu, as configurable. All other sizes will use the menu's full version.

### Responsive Layout for RokGallery & RokSprocket
![][sprocket]
Cerulean comes with the RokGallery and RokSprocket plugins which are built to work with a responsive layout.
