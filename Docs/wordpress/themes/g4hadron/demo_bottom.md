Here is a breakdown of options changes you will want to make to match the demo.

* Set the **Title** to `Get in Touch`.
* Switch the **Align Variation** option to **RT-Center**.
* Enter `fp-bottom` in the **Custom Variations** field.
* Leaving everything else at its default setting, select **Save**.

#### Gantry To Top

The Gantry To Top widget is a simple indicator which allows users to jump to the top of a page with a single click. Just click and drag this widget into the section to activate it.
