    2. **Gantry Copyright** [62%, 29%, se]

Here is the widget breakdown for the Copyright section:

* Gantry Branding
* Gantry Copyright

#### Gantry Branding

The Gantry Branding widget does little more than display our logo at the bottom of the page. Simply click and drag the **Gantry Branding** widget into the widget section for this to appear.

#### Gantry Copyright

The Gantry Copyright widget places a tiny Copyright notification at the bottom of the page. The only thing you need to change in this widget to match the demo is the text field, which includes: `Copyright 2014. Powered by RocketTheme.`.
