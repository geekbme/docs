## Introduction

![](assets/particle_topiclist1.png)

The **Topic List** particle takes the **Category List** particle's simplicity and applies it directly to content at an article level. It lists posts with minimal information in a clean, modern way.

Here are the topics covered in this guide:

* [Configuration](#configuration)
  * [Main Options](#settings)
  * [Item Options](#particle-item-options)
  * [Posts](#posts)
  * [Display](#display)

## Configuration

### Settings 

These options affect the main area of the particle, and not the individual items within.
