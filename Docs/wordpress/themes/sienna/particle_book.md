## Introduction

![](assets/particle_book1.jpg)

The **BookBlock** particle enables you to present content in a way that mimics a book, with its own page turning animation and plenty of room for written and visual content.

Here are the topics covered in this guide:

* [Layout](#layout)
    - [Particle Content](#particle-content)
    - [CMS Content](#cms-content)
* [Configuration](#configuration)
    - [Main Options](#main-options)
    - [Item Options](#item-options)
    - [CMS Options](#cms-options)

## Layout

BookBlock items have a simple, yet robust layout that enables you to add a lot of different types of content in a single item. Each item spans both sides - or pages if you prefer - of the particle's layout. There is, of course, a difference in how this content is sourced depending on whether you are using items created in the particle's settings panel, or from the CMS.

### Particle Content

![](assets/particle_book1.jpg)

:   1. **Item - Category** [5%, 2%, se]
    2. **Item - Intro** [27%, 2%, se]
    3. **Item - Content** [48%, 2%, se]
    4. **Item - Read More Label** [60%, 2%, se]
    5. **Item - Image** [2%, 53%, se]
    6. **Item - Image Title** [73%, 65%, se]
    7. **Item - Image Description** [85%, 66%, se]
    8. **Item - Name** [12%, 2%, se]

One important thing to note when using **Particle** as the **Content Source** is that the name of the item becomes the big title you see in the upper-left area of the particle on the front end. This is in contrast to most particles where the name is a simple reference you only see on the back end.

The rest of this content is set up as an item. Items can be added in the **Block** section of the particle's settings panel. Find out more about [item settings for this particle here](#item-options).

### CMS Content

:   1. **Article - WordPress Category** [2%, 2%, se]
    2. **Article - Article Intro Text** [27%, 2%, se]
    3. **Article - Article Content** [48%, 2%, se]
    4. **Article - Read More Label** [60%, 2%, se]
    5. **Article - Intro Image** [2%, 53%, se]
    6. **Article - Intro Image Alt Text** [73%, 65%, se]
    7. **Article - Intro Image Caption** [85%, 66%, se]
    8. **Article - Title** [12%, 2%, se]

When **WordPress** is selected as the **Content Source**, the post's title becomes the big title in the upper-left area of the particle. The text under the image to the right is made up of the **Alt Text** and **Image Caption** for the **Intro Image** that is assigned to the post.
