### SpliceMenu

![][splice]

SpliceMenu is a new menu option that combines the dynamic, animation-based features of Fusion, with the dropline and sidemenu approach of SplitMenu. The dropline appears on hover, and all further children appear in the sidebar, or another configurable location.

### Popup Login

![][popup]

The login widget is an important element of any site. Nevertheless, it can be a bulky presence on a page, especially if you are conscious of screen space. Tachyon uses a popup login powered by RokBox, which is activated by a single button in the menu bar, to alleviate this.
