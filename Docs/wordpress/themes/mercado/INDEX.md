### Sidepanel

![][sidepanel]

The Sidepanel is forced on every page, and has a grid distribution of 3, leaving 9 to the Mainbody. Therefore, the Gantry layout controls only allow you to edit the Mainbody/Sidebar distribution, and not the Sidepanel distribution. You can switch the left/right position.
