#### Gantry Copyright

The Gantry Copyright widget places a tiny Copyright notification at the bottom of the page. The only thing you need to change in this widget to match the demo is the text field, which includes: `Designed by RocketTheme`.

#### Gantry Divider

This widget tells WordPress to start a new widget column beginning with the widget placed directly below the divider in the section.

#### Gantry To Top

The Gantry To Top widget is a simple indicator which allows users to jump to the top of a page with a single click. Just click and drag this widget into the section to activate it.

#### Gantry Social Buttons

The Gantry Social Buttons widget creates a set of social buttons on the top of the page. Filling this out is fairly straightforward. Once you have clicked and dragged the **Gantry Social Buttons** widget in place, you will want to add your various social URLs to their respective fields. Once this is done, simply hit **Save** and check the site.
