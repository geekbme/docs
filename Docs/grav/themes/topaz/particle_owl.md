## Introduction

![](assets/particle_owl1.jpg)

The **Owl Carousel** particle is a diverse particle with multiple layouts, a wide range of features and customization options, and the ability to source content from both the CMS and custom items set up in the particle itself.

The **Owl Carousel** particle is based on the open source project of the same name by [Bartosz Wojciechowski](http://www.owlcarousel.owlgraphic.com/index.html).

Here are the topics covered in this guide:

* [Layouts](#layouts)
    - [Standard](#standard)
    - [NewsSlider](#newsslider)
    - [Showcase](#showcase)
* [Configuration](#configuration)
    - [Main Options](#main-options)

    - [CMS Options](#cms-options)

## Layouts

Owl Carousel features four layouts, three of which are used in Topaz's demo. You will see examples of these layouts below.

### Standard

The **Standard** layout is a great way to present written content from the CMS, as well as directly from the individual particle. You can display written content, images, or a combination of the two with ease.

### NewsSlider

The **NewsSlider** layout is a great way to pack a lot of written content into a single space. With easy-to-configure tabs opening content items in the particle, this layout type is great for showcasing features and/or providing details about a variety of topics.

### Showcase

The **Showcase** layout enables you to set up a quick and elegant series of links to important content, along with thumbnails. Great for adding a simple list of featured headlines.
