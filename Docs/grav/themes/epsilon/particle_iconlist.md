### Main Options

| Title         | Enter the title of the particle you would like to have appear on the front end. |
| Title Tagline | Enter an introductory line of text here.                                        |
| Grid Column   | Set the number of column(s) to display.                                         |

### Item Options

These items make up the individual featured items in the particle. They sit apart from the particle's title and introduction. Each item can have its own properties, including icons and written content.
