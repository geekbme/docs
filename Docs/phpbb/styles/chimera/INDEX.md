### Animated

The template makes uses of animated effects to add depth and character to content, without compromising on usability and professionalism. A series of introductory bounce and slide effects are built into Chimera, as triggered by scroll events.

### Dynamic Header

The Dynamic, Scrolling Header, is a custom design feature that adds an animation effect the header, where the logo and menu are contained, whereby the header elegantly collapses upon downward scroll and smoothly reappears on upward scroll.

### Imageset Editor

Chimera supports Imageset Editor for previously implemented FontAwesome based scalable vector topic icons. All icons are based on Font Awesome 4. Font Awesome is a pictographic language of web-related actions which delivers over 350 icons.
