Introduction
-----

Afterburner2 is an experiment in how streamlined a RokBB Framework Style can be, whilst still being visually enticing and usable on a live site. This style is perfect for sites where performance is key. A wide set of control options are also available.

The style is built with the RokBB Framework. RokBB is a powerful framework for phpBB, that provides the basis for advanced and extensive administrative control over the styles.

Also, this style presently only supports phpBB 3.0 and is not currently available for phpBB 3.1.


### WebFonts Imageset and Icons

![][webfonts]

Afterburner2 supports WebFonts-based scalable vector icons. No images are used in this style. All icons and imagesets have been converted into sprites. This adds some new indicators (poll icon, unapproved icon, etc.) in addition to other useful features. 

For example: Installing matching language imagesets is not needed as we removed text and replaced it with pictographic language.

### Responsive Layout

![][responsive]

Afterburner2's responsive grid system is designed for desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Each with minor modifications to enhance compatibility in each mode.
