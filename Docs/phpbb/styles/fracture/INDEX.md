Introduction
-----

Fracture, the October 2012 club release, is the first phpBB style which includes RocketLauncher. It is also built on the refreshed RokBB framework, which features a responsive layout core and optimized coding. The template focuses on a clean and minimal design with a unique overlay system for stunning results.

The style also uses LESS, a dynamic stylesheet language, that extends CSS with dynamic behaviour. Modules further benefits from custom styling, adding rich focus to a conservative design backdrop.

Also, this style presently only supports phpBB 3.0 and is not currently available for phpBB 3.1.


### Rocket Launcher

RocketLauncher packages allow you to quickly and easily deploy the Fracture style, including custom configuration and settings that have been professionally tuned to look their best. This gives you a similar install to the RocketTheme demo as seen on the RocketTheme demo server.

### Responsive Layout

Fracture's responsive grid system is designed for desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Each with minor modifications to enhance compatibility in each mode.

We base our responsive layout on Twitter's Bootstrap Framework, with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.
