Introduction
-----

Myriad centers around photography, providing an elegantly designed, visual space for the display of full width photo. The structure allows for the promotion of images, whilst maintaining a refined style for more conservative appearances.

NOTE: **RokBB 5.0.4+** is required for Myriad to work correctly. For more details on installing RokBB, please visit the [Administrative Module installation guide](../../start/styles.md#installing-administrative-modules). Also, this style presently only supports phpBB 3.0 and is not currently available for phpBB 3.1.


### Content Animations

The theme makes uses of animated effects to add depth and character to content, without compromising on usability and professionalism. A series of bounce and slide effects are built into Myriad, as triggered by scroll events, with an option to disable them.

### Color Chooser

Myriad has an extensive Color Chooser in the phpBB ACP to provide intricate controls for each section, inclusive of overlay type, text color, background color, as well as accent colors. Edit preexisting or create your preset.

### Imageset Editor

Myriad supports Imageset Editor for previously implemented FontAwesome based scalable vector topic icons. All icons are based on Font Awesome 4. Font Awesome is a pictographic language of web-related actions which delivers over 350 icons.
