Introduction
-----

Epsilon is a modern, sectioned based design, with a diverse infusion of background textures and patterns. These enrich and differentiate your forum whilst maintaining an overall conservative approach, for flexible site application.

![][style]

The style is built with the RokBB Framework. RokBB is a powerful framework for phpBB, that provides the basis for advanced and extensive administrative control over the styles.

### Flat Design

![][flat]

Epsilon features a flat design that combines simplicity with modern, aesthetic appeal. This style type creates a visually clean look, without sacrificing that unique appeal that sets your site apart.

### WebFonts Imageset and Icons

![][webfonts]

Epsilon supports WebFonts-based scalable vector icons. No images are used in this style. All icons and imagesets have been converted into sprites. This adds some new indicators (poll icon, unapproved icon, etc.) in addition to other useful features. 

For example: Installing matching language imagesets is not needed as we removed text and replaced it with pictographic language.
