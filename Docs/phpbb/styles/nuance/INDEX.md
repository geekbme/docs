Introduction
-----

Nuance is a truly multi-purposed design, suitable for corporate, creative or other web environments. The transparent nature of the style allows the background colors to bleed through to the forefront, to complement and embellish your content.

Also, this style presently only supports phpBB 3.0 and is not currently available for phpBB 3.1.


### WebFonts Imageset and Icons

Nuance supports WebFonts based scalable vector icons, removing the need for images, for better integration and site performance. Other benefits include not needing language imagesets, as the text have been replaced by pictographs, making your forum more accessible.

For example: Installing matching language imagesets is not needed as we removed text and replaced it with pictographic language.

### Color Chooser

Nuance has an extensive Color Chooser in the RokBB Administration Module to provide intricate controls for each section, inclusive of overlay type, text color, background color, as well as accent colors.

### Imageset Editor

Nuance supports Imageset Editor for previously implemented FontAwesome based scalable vector topic icons. All icons are based on Font Awesome 4. Font Awesome is a pictographic language of web-related actions which delivers over 350 icons.
