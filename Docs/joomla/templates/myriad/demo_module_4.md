![][demo]

This area of the front page is a **Custom HTML** module. You will find the settings used in our demo below.

>> Any **mod_custom** (Custom HTML) modules are best handled using either RokPad or no editor as a WYSIWYG editor can cause issues with any code that exists in the **Custom Output** field.

<p class="rt-lead">Myriad centers around photography, providing an elegant space for displaying full width galleries. The structure, whilst focusing on images, maintains a refined and conservative style option.</p>

<p>The theme makes uses of animated effects to add depth and character to content, without compromising on usability and professionalism. A series of bounce and slide effects are built into Myriad, as triggered by scroll events, with an option to disable them.</p>

<p class="visible-large">A responsive layout adapts automatically to the viewing device's width, such as mobile, tablet or desktop, without the need for a separate layout or content. Mobile modes have a unique menu to aid usability. 960px and 1200px fixed layout options are also available.</p>
