## Is Sienna compatible for Joomla 1.5 or 2.5?

No, Sienna is only compatible with Joomla 3.4+.

## Is There a Way to Use a Normal Menu on the Front Page?

Absolutely! Just use a **Menu** particle or module in place of the Overlay Toggle particle in the Navigation section.

## What is Gantry?

[Gantry][gantry] is, as a basic definition, a framework used for assembling, building and maintaining a RocketTheme template. It is an advanced platform for dramatically extending the capabilities of the entire theming system of Joomla.

## Can I install RocketLauncher onto an existing Joomla! website?

No. RocketLauncher will install both Joomla and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh Joomla! installation.

## I installed Sienna RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.

To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.
