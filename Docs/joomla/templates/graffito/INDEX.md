### Responsive Layout

![][responsive]

Graffito's responsive grid system is designed for desktop, tablet and smartphone systems - each with minor modifications to ensure compatibility in each mode.

We use the responsive layout based on Twitter's Bootstrap Framework, with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.

The table below shows the breakdown of screen resolutions and associated devices, and which layout characters are then applied to each.

| Label                  | Description                                | Layout Width     | Column Width |

Graffito is the first RocketTheme template built on the Gantry4 Framework with a new, faster administration UI. One of the other exciting new features is the ability to use LESS CSS to make developing templates easier, more flexible, and overall, more enjoyable.
