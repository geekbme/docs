Introduction
-----
Fracture, the September 2012 template release, is the first RocketTheme template to be built on the Gantry4 Framework, which features a responsive layout core, a rejuvenated administrative interface and optimized coding. The template focuses on a clean and minimal design with a unique overlay system for stunning results.

The template also uses LESS, a dynamic stylesheet language, that extends CSS with dynamic behaviour. RokSprocket further benefits from custom styling, adding rich focus to a conservative design backdrop.

### Responsive Layout
![][responsive]
Fracture's responsive grid system is designed for desktop, tablet and smartphone systems, each with minor modifications to ensure compatibility in each mode.

We use the responsive layout based on Twitter's Bootstrap Framework, with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.

The table below shows the breakdown of screen resolutions and associated devices, and which layout characters are then applied to each.

| Label                  | Description                                | Layout Width     | Column Width |
