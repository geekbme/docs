## Is Aurora compatible for Joomla 1.5 or 2.5?

No, Aurora is only compatible with Joomla 3.4+.

## What is Gantry?

[Gantry][gantry] is, as a basic definition, a framework used for assembling, building and maintaining a RocketTheme template. It is an advanced platform for dramatically extending the capabilities of the entire theming system of Joomla.

## Can I install RocketLauncher onto an existing Joomla! website?

No. RocketLauncher will install both Joomla and the demo sample content and images, so you will need a fresh Joomla! installation.

## I installed Aurora RocketLauncher but the images are different with the demo site.

To avoid image license copyright issues, all sample content images shown in our demo site will be replaced with blank versions in the RocketLauncher version.
