### Responsive Layout
![][responsive]
Alerion's responsive grid system is designed for desktop, tablet and smartphone systems, each with minor modifications to ensure compatibility in each mode.

We use the responsive layout based on Twitter's Bootstrap Framework, with its collection of utility classes, to provide a great degree of flexibility for a responsive design.

The table below shows the breakdown of screen resolutions and associated devices, and which layout characters are then applied to each.

| Label                  | Description                                | Layout Width     | Column Width |  
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------- | :----------- |  
| Smartphones            | Standard smartphones                       | 480px and below  | 100% fluid   |  
| Smartphones to Tablets | Larger smartphones and small tablets       | 767px and below  | 100% fluid   |  
| Tablets                | Larger tablets                             | 768px and above  | 64px         |  
| Desktop                | Standard desktops and laptops              | 960px and above  | 80px         |

### QuickNav and Floating Module
![][quicknavmenu]
QuickNav adds a scrolling menu that follows your viewport as you scroll. You can set an icon with FontAwesome icon format.

The Floating Module feature that allows you to 'bounce' a module between the template sections. You can set a starting position and the end position for the module, as well as the stopping offset point. The stopping offset will stop the module in the exact offset position you would like.

The floating module feature also allows a module position to follow the users viewport.

### Parallax Background
![][parallax]
Parallax is apparent motion of a 3D object depending on your perspective. This effect has been transposed into the template, allowing configurable areas to move based on scroll position.
