The **RokSprocket Features** module used here is a great way to feature some of your site's more notable articles or areas of interest.

We utilized the **Simple** Content Provider, allowing us to create custom content independent of full articles. The **Title**, **Description**, and **Image** fields in each article have been altered. A few examples of these article changes can be found below, excluding the **Image** fields which will likely not work on your local copy as the links will be different.

>> NOTE: If you are using the v1.1 RocketLauncher, there are some special instructions concerning the handling of the preset images for this module. If you notice your images aren't changing as expected, or if you would like more information on how this was set up, you can find it [here](demo.md#roksprocket-and-rocketlauncher-settings).
