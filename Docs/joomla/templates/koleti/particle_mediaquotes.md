| CSS Classes | Enter the CSS class(es) you want to use in the content of the particle. |
| Title       | Enter the title of the particle, as it will appear on the front end.    |
| Grid Column | Select then number of columns quotes appear in.                         |

### Particle Items

These items make up the individual featured items in the particle. They sit apart from the particle's title, headline, image, and description. Each item can have its own properties, including images and written content.
